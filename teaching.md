# Training

 - [Artificial Intelligence in Teaching and Learning](https://valedominho.com/a137t1) course by [Centro de Formação Vale do Minho](https://valedominho.com/) (May to July 2025)
   - 25-hour course about the applications of AI in education, including personalized learning, assessment, and feedback.
   - The target audience were teachers from the 1st to the 3rd cycle of basic education and secondary education.
   - I was responsible for teaching the entire course, including the introduction to AI and GenAI, as well as their applications in the educational context. 
   - Unfortunately (or not!), the materials are in Portuguese.
     - ...

 - [AI and Ethics: Challenges and Opportunities](https://valedominho.com/a136t2) (Second Edition) course by [Centro de Formação Vale do Minho](https://valedominho.com/) (April to June 2025)
   - 25-hour course about the ethical implications of AI technologies, including bias, transparency, and accountability.
   - The target audience were teachers from the 1st to the 3rd cycle of basic education and secondary education.
   - I was involved in the initial introduction to AI and GenAI, as well as their applications in the educational context.
   - Unfortunately (or not!), the materials are in Portuguese.
