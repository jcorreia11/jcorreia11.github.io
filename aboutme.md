Hello! I'm João Correia, co-founder and head of cheminformatics development at OmniumAI, and an invited assistant professor at the Catholic University of Portugal in Braga. I hold a Ph.D. in Informatics from the University of Minho (2024), a Master’s in Bioinformatics from the same institution (2018), and a Bachelor’s in Bioengineering from the University of Trás-os-Montes e Alto Douro (2016). My research is focused on developing artificial intelligence methods for analyzing chemical data.


## StartUp Co-Founder

In June 2021, I co-founded a startup named [OmniumAI](https://www.omniumai.com/) which is a spin-off of the University of Minho created from the Centre of Biological Engineering. 
OmniumAI is focused on developing AI solutions for the life sciences, particularly in the areas of chemoinformatics and bioinformatics.
